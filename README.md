# codebook-support
Facilitates use of the FF documentation (beta version here)

Dawn Koffman in the Office of Population Research at Princeton built some additional codebook support beyond the main Fragile Families documentation.

This is a beta version. The official source of documentation is still http://www.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/documentation.
